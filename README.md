### Versioning

Major-Minor-Patch

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.
   Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

and also supported by [cider](https://pub.dev/packages/cider).

to patch: `cider bump patch --bump-build` or `make patch`
to minor: `cider bump minor --bump-build` or `make minor`
to major: `cider bump major --bump-build` or `make major`

docs: Documentation only changes
style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
perf: A code change that improves performance
test: Adding missing tests
build: Changes to the build/compilation/packaging process or auxiliary tools such as documentation generation
ci: Changes in the continuous integration/delivery setup
