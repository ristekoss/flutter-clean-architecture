Flutter Template

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Getting Started

### üöö How to run, drive, and build Apk

Add .env file to the project directory (see .env.example)

Example how to run development app
```
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter run
```

Example how to run production app
```
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter build apk -t lib/main_production.dart
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Supported Flavor

1. staging
2. production

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Module generator

In order to minimize your effort in repetitive code writing, you can use the module_generator.dart

simply run

```
dart run .\module_generator.dart
```

and insert your module name (example: catalog)

### üß¨Ô∏è State Management

Since we use clean architecture, it doesn't matter what state management you prefer to use  

But for this project example, we use [Bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) 

### API Documentation

[DummyJson](https://dummyjson.com/docs/)

This boilerplate use DummyJson for remote data sources  

See [Auth](https://dummyjson.com/docs/auth) to obtain username and password to login in this app
